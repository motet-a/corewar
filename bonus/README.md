# corewar - bonus explanation

[![Build Status](https://ci.antoine.network/job/Corewar/lastBuild/badge/icon)](https://ci.antoine.network/job/Corewar/lastBuild/)

The corewar assembler and VM, bonus part.

## Explanation

This project is divided in three bonus:

* An automated unit test platform in real time using the Jenkins application and docker B-Linux container to do unit test.

* An application coupled with an Jenkins enable an assessment to do a review of code quality in buildlogs and make different build levels: stable, unstable and failure; according to the code quality generated and warning(s)/error(s) during compilation.

* A social BOT who send in real-time in our workspaces a summary of the last commit/push made using our code review application.

All these bonuses represent a significant time can be very useful for the maintainability of an application or a heavy project (open source or not) in company.
